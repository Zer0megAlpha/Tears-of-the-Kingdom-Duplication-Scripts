# Duplicate materials using the holding/midair glitch
# This version of the glitch maximizes how many items you can duplicate in a single jump while simultaneously avoiding the tradeoff of losing shield durability. This script is slightly harder to setup because you need to make manual changes to the code but the tradeoffs are worth it. It's faster than the x5 method and doesn't use up shield durability.
# You need to be in a low gravity environment for this script to work. Teleport to the Igoshon Shrine and just stand outside the shrine. Have your menu selection set to materials and hover over the material you wish to duplicate. Exit your item menu. Then run this script.

# Notes
# It's better to run this script on a loop since we can't run nested loops in the script. Joy-Con Droid TAS has a settings button where the "Should loop" setting is. Just have that checked.
# You also need to know the number of x,y movements and replace the two sections of code down below with the number of movements so that you always dupe the item you want. If you don't do this, you'll be duping other items.

# Make the consistency of this method match the x5 method so that people can setup this method easier
