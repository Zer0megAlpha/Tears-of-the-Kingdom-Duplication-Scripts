# Duplicate any material with this script by equipping your bow and hitting D-Pad Up to get to your combine material UI then select which material you want to duplicate. After exiting, run the script.

# Notes
# If this script doesn't work initially, trying waiting a bit since this script's performance is dependant on the FPS drops of the location you're in
# The glitch seems to work best when you're in Kakariko village looking a bit up at the sky as that's probably where the FPS drops
# This script is mostly self correcting so if there's a missing input just wait it out unless the following happens
# In very rare circumstances, due to lag and changes in FPS, the script could accidentally consume items. I don't recommend running this script without supervision.
# You must take full responsibility for this script knowing the risks mentioned above

# TODO
# There are opportunities to make this script faster at the expense of higher rates of missed inputs or increasing timed inputs for higher chances of input recognition
# There's definitely a balance threshold between these two
