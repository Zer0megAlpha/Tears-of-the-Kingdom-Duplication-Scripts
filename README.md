# Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Duplication-Scripts
This repo holds scripts designed to run on The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. These scripts are loaded in through Joy-Con Droid and only work up to version 1.1.1

Building stuff in this game is fun but the grind for materials is annoying if you just want to build cool stuff. That's why I created these scripts to automate the process of duplicating items. I figured others might make use of this.

# Duplicate materials
Run duplicate_materials.txt if you want to use the old method duping method before the holding midair glitch was discovered. It's slower but potentially useful.

# Duplicate zonai
Run the duplicate_zonai.txt if you want to dupe all the zonai parts your little engineering hearts crave.

# Fast Duplicate Materials x20
Run the fast_duplicate_materials_x20.txt if you want the latest and greatest way to duplicate items. It takes a little setup but it's worth it because compared to the x5 script, you don't waste any shield durability and it's faster.

# Fast Duplicate Materials x5
Run the fast_duplicate_materials_x5.txt if you want the easiest method to start duplicating items. You will have to exchange 5 duped items for 1 shield durability. That's the only tradeoff.

# How to run these scripts
To use these scripts, once you've connected your Joy-Con Droid to your switch, select the TAS UI from "Select Custom UI" then load the script of choice and click run.
